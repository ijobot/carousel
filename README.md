This was first introduction to carousels in javascript.  The intention of this tutorial was to get me to build a carousel from scratch, rather than depending on a library of premade options.  The course was taught by Karl Hadwen, who makes it a point that his students know the behind-the-scenes funtionality of various web designs.  Since a carousel is so ubiquitous, and since it uses such a wide variety of JS methods, it was the perfect project to further familiarize myself with the language.
